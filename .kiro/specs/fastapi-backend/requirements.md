# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy for an LLM-powered documentation application. The backend will support multi-tenant architecture, asynchronous LLM processing, real-time updates via WebSockets, and integration with external knowledge management systems. The system will handle document management, AI-powered summarization, custom templates, and external integrations while maintaining security and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured FastAPI application with SQLAlchemy ORM, so that I can build a scalable multi-tenant backend for the documentation app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is started THEN the FastAPI application SHALL be accessible via HTTP
2. WHEN database models are defined THEN SQLAlchemy SHALL provide ORM functionality with PostgreSQL
3. WHEN the application starts THEN database migrations SHALL be handled via Alembic
4. WHEN requests are made THEN the application SHALL support CORS for frontend integration
5. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL be containerized with Docker for consistent deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want multi-tenant data isolation, so that each organization's data remains completely separate and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database query is executed THEN it SHALL filter by org_id to ensure tenant isolation
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN their org_id SHALL be attached to all subsequent requests
3. WHEN creating any tenant-specific record THEN it SHALL include the appropriate org_id
4. WHEN accessing data THEN users SHALL only see data belonging to their organization
5. WHEN database indexes are created THEN they SHALL include org_id for efficient multi-tenant queries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate securely, so that I can access my organization's documents and features safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN their password SHALL be securely hashed before storage
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL receive a JWT token for subsequent requests
3. WHEN accessing protected endpoints THEN the JWT token SHALL be validated
4. WHEN a token expires THEN the user SHALL be required to re-authenticate
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be returned

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage documents (upload, view, edit, delete), so that I can maintain my organization's knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a document THEN it SHALL be stored with proper metadata and org_id
2. WHEN listing documents THEN only documents from the user's org SHALL be returned
3. WHEN viewing a document THEN full content and associated summaries SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN updating a document THEN changes SHALL be saved with updated timestamps
5. WHEN deleting a document THEN all associated summaries SHALL be cascade deleted
6. WHEN document content contains Unicode characters THEN they SHALL be preserved correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate AI-powered summaries of documents, so that I can quickly understand key information without reading full content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting a summary THEN the task SHALL be processed asynchronously via Celery
2. WHEN a summary job is queued THEN a job_id SHALL be returned immediately
3. WHEN the LLM processes content THEN the result SHALL be stored in the Summaries table
4. WHEN a summary is complete THEN the user SHALL be notified via WebSocket
5. WHEN using custom templates THEN the template SHALL be applied to format the LLM prompt
6. WHEN a summary fails THEN error information SHALL be logged and accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage custom summary templates, so that I can tailor AI outputs to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a template THEN it SHALL be associated with the user's organization
2. WHEN listing templates THEN both global and org-specific templates SHALL be available
3. WHEN using a template THEN placeholder content SHALL be properly substituted
4. WHEN updating a template THEN changes SHALL not affect existing summaries
5. WHEN deleting a template THEN it SHALL not break existing summary references

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect external integrations (Notion, Confluence, etc.), so that I can import documents and publish summaries to my existing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting an integration THEN OAuth2 flow SHALL be handled securely
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest
3. WHEN importing documents THEN external content SHALL be fetched and stored locally
4. WHEN publishing summaries THEN they SHALL be sent to the configured external platform
5. WHEN integration fails THEN appropriate error handling and retry logic SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time notifications, so that I know immediately when background tasks complete or new content is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection is established THEN it SHALL be authenticated and org-scoped
2. WHEN background jobs complete THEN notifications SHALL be sent via WebSocket
3. WHEN integration events occur THEN relevant users SHALL receive real-time updates
4. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle reconnection
5. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN each SHALL receive only their org's events

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the backend is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing business logic THEN unit tests SHALL be written for each function
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN integration tests SHALL verify request/response behavior
3. WHEN testing multi-tenancy THEN tests SHALL verify data isolation between orgs
4. WHEN testing async operations THEN Celery tasks SHALL have dedicated test coverage
5. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL be executable via Docker commands for consistency

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want proper logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail and context
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN request/response information SHALL be logged
3. WHEN background jobs run THEN their status and results SHALL be tracked
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN error details SHALL be captured for debugging
5. WHEN the system starts THEN health check endpoints SHALL be available for monitoring
